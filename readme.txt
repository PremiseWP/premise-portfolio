Display a modern and minimalistic portfolio on your site. This is the official portfolio plugin used across premisewp.com to display the themes and plugins that we build.

== Description ==

This plugin is in beta and should be used as such (there might be bugs but we are quickly fixing them :) ). This plugin was build to display the premise portfolio for <a href="http://premisewp.com" target="_blank">premisewp.com</a> so we could showcase the themes and plugins we build, like this one.

== Installation ==

This section describes how to install the plugin and get it working.

e.g.

1. Upload the plugin main folder to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory, or install the plugin through the WordPress plugins screen directly.
2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' screen in WordPress
3. Start adding Portfolio Items :)
